The student must have a GPA of at least 3.5 (gpa >= 3.5) to qualify for the scholarship.
Additionally, the student must have participated in either sports (sportsParticipation is true) or community service (communityService is true).
If the student meets both the GPA requirement and participated in sports or community service, they are eligible for the scholarship.

Exercise 1: Static and Final
Create a class called "MathUtils" with the following specifications:

Include a static method called "multiply" that takes two integers as parameters and returns their product.
Include a final variable called "PI" with a value of 3.14159.
Create an instance method called "add" that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum.
Exercise 2: Access Modifiers
Create a package called "vehicles" with the following classes:

Create a public class called "Vehicle" with a protected instance variable called "manufacturer" and a public method called "getManufacturer" to retrieve its value.
Create a default class called "Car" that extends "Vehicle" and has a private instance variable called "model". Implement a public method called "getModel" to retrieve its value.
Exercise 3: Enumerations
Create an enumeration called "DayOfWeek" with the following days: SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY. Create a method called "isWeekend" that takes a "DayOfWeek" parameter and returns true if it is a weekend day (Saturday or Sunday), and false otherwise.

Exercise 4: Inheritance
Create a class called "Shape" with an instance variable called "color" and a method called "getColor" to retrieve its value.

Create a class called "Circle" that extends "Shape" and includes an additional instance variable called "radius". Implement a method called "getArea" that returns the area of the circle.
Create a class called "Rectangle" that extends "Shape" and includes two additional instance variables called "width" and "height". Implement a method called "getArea" that returns the area of the rectangle.
