		/*
		 * Advantages:
		 * 
		 * Method Overriding: When we call dog.makeSound(), the overridden makeSound()
		 * method from the Dog class is invoked at runtime, printing "Dog is barking".
		 * This demonstrates that the appropriate method implementation is determined
		 * dynamically based on the actual object type (Dog in this case).
		 * 
		 * Flexibility and Extensibility: Since dog is declared as Animal, we are
		 * restricted to using only the methods and properties available in the Animal
		 * class. If we had declared Dog dog = new Dog();, we would have access to both
		 * the makeSound() method and the fetch() method. However, by declaring dog as
		 * Animal, we cannot directly invoke the fetch() method on the dog object. This
		 * restriction allows for flexibility in substituting different animal types
		 * without affecting the code that uses the Animal reference
		 * 
		 * Extensibility: If you add new subclasses in the future, they can choose
		 * whether to override the makeSound method or inherit the default behavior from
		 * the superclass. This provides flexibility and extensibility in your class
		 * hierarchy.
