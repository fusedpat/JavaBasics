		/**
		 * Rules:Method name: The methods being overloaded must have the same name.
		 * R
		 * Parameter list: The parameter lists of the methods must be different. This
		 * can be achieved by having a different number of parameters or different types
		 * of parameters.
		 * 
		 * Return type: The return type of the methods is <b>not</b> considered during method
		 * overloading. Overloaded methods can have the same or different return types.
		 * 
		 * Access modifiers: The access modifiers (e.g., public, private, protected) and
		 * other modifiers (e.g., static, final) may be different for the overloaded
		 * methods.
		 * 
		 * Exception handling: Overloaded methods can throw different exceptions.
		 * However, if a method in a superclass declares an exception, the overriding
		 * methods in the subclasses can only declare the same exception or a subclass
		 * of that exception.
		 * 
		 * Method resolution: During compilation, the Java compiler determines which
		 * method to call based on the number and types of arguments provided. The
		 * decision is made based on the closest match between the arguments and the
		 * parameters of the available overloaded methods.
